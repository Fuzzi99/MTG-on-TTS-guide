**About:** TableTop Simulator is the number one way to play any TableTop game on your computer, it's effectively just a glorified physics engine that's been modded to hell and back to support almost every possible TableTop game you can think of.


***How to setup***
1. Purchase and install TableTop Simulator from Steam
2. Download one or more of the following workshop items (All of them contain life trackers and other tracking methods for counters etc):
   1. [Modern Wood MTG 6 Player Table](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2063665075) Room for 6 players, with Exile Deck and Yard in the corner of each play area, along with an untap everything button down there too
   2. [MTG Table for Commander/Drafting/Deckbuilding](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2084202264) Has zones for everything in 6 player locations, slightly smaller play area than some others.
   3. [MTG: Commander Table](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2050465528) Only 4 play areas compared to the other's 6 however comes with a collection of preconstructed decks to the side and is the location to get the deckbox objects to store your decks and tokens in inside TTS. This one also contains all tokens released up till 2019.
4. Download the TTS-Deckconverter application from [GitHub](https://github.com/jeandeaual/tts-deckconverter)
   - This application is the only method that consistently works to download your deck into the game and have it showup for every player in the game
   - The MTG: Commander Table does have a tappedout.net importer but that system is extremly buggy and only works 5% of the time and not for every player.
   - Don't use Archidekt however as that is broken but not being fixed as it's an issue on EDHRec's side.
5. Once you've imported a deck or two with the TTS-Deckconverter, create a new game in TTS and choose the table you subscribed to earlier from the Steam Workshop.
6. To Bring your deck out:
   1. Click Objects in the top bar
   2. Click Saved Objects in the pop up
   3. Drag the deck and Tokens from there to the board that you wish to play
   4. Right click on your deck and select Search
   5. Drag your commander out of the deck and close the search
   6. hover over your commander and the token pile and press 'f' to flip them over
   7. You can now play with this deck or put it in a deckbox and save to a folder of saved objects:

      1. If you saved an empty deckbox from the MTG: Commander Table version bring one of those out
      2. Click and hold over the deck to pick the whole deck up, then drop over the deckbox
      3. Repeat for Commander and Token piles
      4. Right click on the deckbox and at the bottom where it says deckbox type in the name of the deck
      5. Still in the right click menu, click Save Object, you can then name it what you like and organise by folders
7. To play the game in TTS, you then just shuffle the deck with the 'r' key with the mouse over the deck, and draw 7 by pressing the '7' key with the mouse over the deck.
